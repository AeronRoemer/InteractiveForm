# Interactive Form
Created based on project from Teamtreehouse.com. If you are also student and 
working on this or a similar project, feel free to reach out to me with any
questions about this code. I've made an effort to include helpful comments and
documentation for fellow learners. 

## Basic Structure

'Interactive Form' is a HTML form that uses jQuery to implement additional
functionality, including credit card and email validation. It is enhanced by 
CSS created in SASS.

### Concepts Demonstrated

The main technologies and concepts demonstrated in this project are

* jQuery
* Regular Expressions
* HTML5 forms
* Form validation
* Sass - the CSS was created as a .sass file and converted to .css
* Progressive Enhancement - having javascript turned on adds to accessibility,
  but is not required for site to function.
